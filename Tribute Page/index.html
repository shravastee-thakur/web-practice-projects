            Gaansaraswati Padma Vibhushan Kishori Amonkar (10 April 1932 – 3
            April 2017) was a leading Indian classical vocalist, belonging to
            the Jaipur gharana or a community of musicians sharing a distinctive
            musical style. She was a performer of the classical genre khyal and
            the light classical genres thumri and bhajan. Amonkar trained under
            her mother, classical singer Mogubai Kurdikar also from the Jaipur
            gharana, but she experimented with a variety of vocal styles in her
            career. The magnetic charm of Gaanasaraswati Kishori Amonkar
            attracted millions, who would come from places near and far and wait
            for her patiently to delight in her soul stirring voice. For Kishori
            Amonkar, music wasn’t entertainment. It was not to be sung to
            attract the audience. She said
            <span
              >“when the sur” comes out of my inner being, my body will
              disappear. I pray to God that I die that way”.</span
            >
            Her Maker had answered her appeal; she had passed away in her sleep,
            on April, 3, a Reigning Queen of *Sur* till the end.
